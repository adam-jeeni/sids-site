 	<h3>&diams; 4 tips for getting the best from your cleaner</h3>
    <div class="did-you-know-block">
        <p>
        <ol>
					<li>Ensure your house is in order before your cleaner arrives. She will have more time to focus on cleaning rather than clearing.</li>
					<li>Tell your cleaner what you want and what you expect. This way they can focus on what you really want rather than what they assume you want.</li>
					<li>Do not be afraid to complain. We would rather you told us so we can put things right before they become an issue.</li>
					<li>Praise and support. If your cleaning does something particularly well, tell them. Then we can put this into our routine in other houses.</li>

    <h3>&diams; How to choose a great cleaner</h3>
    <div class="did-you-know-block">
        <p>
        When you are employing a cleaner, whether it’s through a company or directly, follow these tips to help you choose a great cleaner.
				<ol>
<li>Make sure you meet the person who the cleaner is directly responsible to. This face-to-face contact enables you to judge whether you trust the cleaning company and the cleaner. Don’t forget – if you have any issues you’ll want to take it up with the company, not the cleaner.</li>
<li>Take up at least 3 references. A good cleaner will have a good track record. If the cleaner is new, and that’s not uncommon, then take up some references about the cleaning company the cleaner works for.</li>
<li>Make sure the cleaner is fit. Cleaning is a demanding and physical job. You can’t clean if you can’t get up the stairs.</li>
<li>Communication. You need to be able to communicate your needs to the cleaner, and if anything happens, the cleaner need to be able to communicate with you.</li>
</ol>

    <h3>&diams; 5 useful bleach tips</h3>
    <div class="did-you-know-block mtop-0">
        <p>
				<ol>
<li>Bleach does not clean, it disinfects. So wipe down surfaces first to get the dirt of and then use bleach to kill the bacteria.</li>
<li>Bleach does not remove the stains in your toilet lime scale in your bath/taps. It just bleaches them so their harder to see. Scrub the stains away with a brush, or better still, a scouring pad. Use lime scale cleaner to on taps and shower doors. Then use <li>bleach to sterilise the area and create a clean smell.</li>
<li>A spoonful of bleach added to your washing water will make your dishes and glassware shine and sparkle. Be sure to rinse well and dry with dry with a soft towel.</li>
<li>A few drops of bleach into a vase (about ¼ teaspoon for a liter of water), and a teaspoon of sugar will help your flowers last longer by feeding your plant and keeping bacteria at bay.</li>

    <h3>&diams; The cleaning power of coke</h3>
    <div class="did-you-know-block">
		<p>
<ol>
<li>Got a burned pan or a pan with cooked on scrabbled egg? Soak in coke for a few hours and just wipe off.</li>
<li>Coke can remove blood stains. Just soak the area in coke, and then wash off after a few minutes. The coke will have emulsified the blood stain. Clean cloths!</li>
<li>Pour coke in the toilet and leave for 20 minutes. Flush – now you have a clean loo!</li>
<li>Coke can be used to clear an upset stomach. Shake the bottle until it goes flat and then drink. This is a favourite used by surfers the world over.</li>
